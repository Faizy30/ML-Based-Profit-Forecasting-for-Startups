# ML-Based-Profit-Forecasting-for-Startups
ML-Based Profit Forecasting for Startups is a machine learning project designed to predict the profit of startup companies based on key financial factors such as R&amp;D expenditure, administrative costs, marketing budgets, and geographical location. 


# 📈 ML-Based Profit Forecasting for Startups

This project uses machine learning to predict the **profitability of startups** based on key business factors such as R&D spend, administration costs, marketing spend, and location. By building regression models, it helps estimate future profits, aiding better financial planning for early-stage companies.

## 🧠 Objective

To develop a machine learning model that predicts startup profit using features like:
- R&D Spend
- Administration Expenses
- Marketing Spend
- State (Location)

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **Source:** [50_Startups Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhirajsingh1999/50-startups)
- **Size:** 50 rows × 5 columns
- **Features:**
  - R&D Spend
  - Administration
  - Marketing Spend
  - State
  - Profit (Target)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Understand feature correlations
   - Handle categorical features (One-Hot Encoding)

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Convert categorical "State" column
   - Normalize/scale data if needed

3. **Modeling**
   - Linear Regression
   - Multiple Linear Regression
   - Polynomial Regression (optional)

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - R² Score
   - RMSE, MAE
   - Residual Plots

5. **Prediction**
   - Forecast future profits based on input variables
